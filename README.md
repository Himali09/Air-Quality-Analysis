# Air-Quality-Analysis

Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is. Monitoring air quality is important because polluted air can be bad for our healthâ€”and the health of the environment. Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The AQI works sort of like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees.
